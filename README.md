# Curriculum-Approval-System

This website was made using PHP for Mount Royal University. The website is designed to be a proof of concept for a system that professors at MRU could use to approve changes to course outlines. Users can log into the system and be able to create requests for curriculum changes. Also, they can approve or deny changes that other users request. Users can keep track of the approval stage of their request as it is tracked and visualized on a progress bar. The CSS framework Bootstrap was utilized to design a large portion of the front-end design. Bootstrap allows the website to be functional across a wide range of platforms such as phones, tablets, and desktop computers. Using Bootstrap sped up the development of the project and allowed the project to be completed within the given time constraints. The backend of the website utilized a MySQL database that kept track of account and request information.
